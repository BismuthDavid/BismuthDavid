Hi there! 
I'm David Bismuth,and I have over 4 years of experience as a business analyst.

Driven by my passion for coding and programming, I've embarked on a journey to enhance my 
skills and become the best version of myself as both an analyst and a programmer. 

Currently, I'm immersed in a learning program called 'Mego', designed for ultra-Orthodox Jews, 
aiming to diversify the hi-tech workforce in Israel and provide access to the tech world for 
individuals whose life paths might not have led them there otherwise. 

Excited to see where this journey takes me!
